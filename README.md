## Routes
There are two main routes present in the application. 

### 1. /webhook/payment `POST`
- This route can be protected with `validate` middleware present in the application. Make sure to add `x-payment-signature` in the header of the API request with the actual signature of the incoming payment details.

- Use the sample payload given in the *Test* section to try this out.

### 2. /payments/<payment-id>/events `GET`
- Use this to receive all the events for a particular payment ID
- Eg: /payments/pay_001/events
